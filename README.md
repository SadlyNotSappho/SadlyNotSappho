### Hi there! I'm SapphicSapphire.
I've had GitHub for a bit, but I haven't made anything that I feel like I can release yet.
My pronouns are **She/Her**, and I'm a lesbian.

I'm learning Rust (well, I just have to learn a few things before I can say that I "know" Rust), and I'm decent at TypeScript.

I play D&D and Skyrim, and I like Stranger Things. I used to play Minecraft a lot more than I currently do.
